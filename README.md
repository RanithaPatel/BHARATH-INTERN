# BHARATH-INTERN
# Data Science Internship Project

## Overview
This repository contains the completion of tasks for the Data Science internship conducted by Bharath Intern. The tasks include building an Email Classifier and a Dog and Cat Classifier.

## Tasks

### Email Classifier:
- Implemented an email classifier to categorize emails into different classes.
- Utilized machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines.
- Preprocessed the dataset to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- Achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset.

### Dog and Cat Classifier:
- Developed a classifier to distinguish between images of dogs and cats.
- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
- Used data augmentation techniques to enhance the performance of the model.
- Attained a validation accuracy of 85% on a held-out dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-science-internship.git`
